**Objective:** Estimate the labour market earnings-gap by educational attainment and by race/ethnicity sub-samples. The data used in this paper is a subset extracted from the 2011 American Community Survey (ACS), a cross-sectional, nationally representative data of 2,128,104 households.

**Technologies Used:** R, Jupyter, log-linear regression

**Result/Key Takeaways:** We find that after controlling for gender, marital status, age, and race/ethnicity, higher educational attainment levels confer statistically significant (p < 0.001) premia on earnings. However, controlling for educational attainment levels, age, gender, and marital status, the non-Hispanic Whites earn statistically significantly more (p < 0.001) than the Blacks and Hispanics. We also find that the earnings gap between non-Hispanic Whites and Asians are neither statistically nor economically substantively significant.
